I'll have a meeting in English tomorrow for the current project.
The meeting is scheduled to last 30 minutes.

I didn't have to prepare something because some of my friends have already bought some food and drinks.
We can use the BBQ place in Granville island as long as we don't drink alcohol.
I try to retrace the last BBQ, I think I should have left my home early a bit to get to the place on time no matter what happen.
