### Vancuverは好き? どうですか?

I like Vancouver because I think Vancouver is a very diverse city.
There are many people who are from different countries here in Vancouver. We can meet easily Japanese, Chinese, ... and stuff.
So I can learn about other countries' cultures and I can enjoy various cuisines from different countries.

### なぜバンクーバーに来た

Because I want to improve my English skills. I used to work as a ... I like the job and I want to keep working as ... so I have to enhance my programming skills and learn computer science. For that, I have to study English I thought when I was in Japan.
I could stay in Japan and continue working, but I wanted to try to work in other countries if I have a chance.

The reason why I decided to move to Vancouver is I thought it would be highly likely to get a job because there are a lot of tech companies.
If I had moved to other countries, I might not have found a job even if I can speak English well.
I would say the number of Tech companies is less than in Vancouver.

### オフィスに行くかリモートワークか

I prefer working in an office to remote work.
When I don't understand something at work, I can immediately ask my coworkers.

## パンデミックの影響で
I like traveling and I want to go to other cities such as Toronto and I want to go to Seattle as well.
Because of the pandemic, I haven't been to other cities yet.

### 5/7
I took advantage of Prettier to format js, twig, scss, and php because it's definitely useful for a developer.
I want to take initiative in working on website and web application development.
